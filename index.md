If you are looking for a place to have thankgiving dinner in Temcula this site has all the details you need.

## Why we made this site

Our family likes to have Thanksgiving at a local restaurant.  It saves us having to wash dishes, gives us more family time and an opportunity to dress up.  In order to do that, we need to know what restaurants are open and what their menus are.
